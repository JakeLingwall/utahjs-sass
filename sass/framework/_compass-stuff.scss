/*don't want to focus on compass too much. 
But it gives you some mixins that are quite handy out the gate.
You can see them here: 
http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/*/
.half-opacity{
  @include opacity(.5);
}

.column-layour{
  @include columns(3);
}

.border-radius{
  @include border-radius(3px);
}

/*the best one =)*/
.transition{
  @include transition(all, 30s)
}
